This script automates the process of subdomain enumeration and scanning using several popular open-source tools, combining their results and providing detailed output. The primary purpose of this tool is to simplify and streamline the process of discovering subdomains and their related information for a given domain.

## **Features**

- Uses Amass, Subfinder, Assetfinder, Findomain, crt.sh, MassDNS, Httpx, Naabu, and Nuclei
- Combines subdomain results from all tools into a single file
- Extracts IP addresses for discovered subdomains
- Scans subdomains with Httpx and sorts the results
- Scans subdomains with Naabu to find open ports
- Scans subdomains with Nuclei for potential vulnerabilities
- Organizes results in a structured directory
- The tool follows a logical structure to gather the subdomains and information from each tool to be used by the next one.
- Postive httpx subdomains are used for scanning by Nuclei.

## **Installation**

1. If you have Go installed and configured (i.e. with $GOPATH/bin in your $PATH):

```
go install github.com/TaurusOmar/reconbulk@latest

```

2. Install all required tools:
- **[Amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass)**
- **[Subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder)**
- **[Assetfinder](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder)**
- **[Findomain](https://github.com/Findomain/Findomain)**
- **[MassDNS](https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns)**
- **[Httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx)**
- **[Naabu](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu)**
- **[Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei)**

Make sure all these tools are in your system's **`PATH`**.

3. Prepare a list of DNS resolvers. You can find a sample list **[here](https://public-dns.info/nameservers.txt)**.

## **Usage**

```
reconbulk <domain> <resolvers_list>

```

- **`<domain>`**: The target domain to scan
- **`<resolvers_list>`**: The file path to your list of DNS resolvers

The script will create a directory named **`~/recon/results/<domain>-<timestamp>`** containing the output files from each tool.

## **Output**

The output directory will contain the following files:

- amass_{domain}.txt: Output from Amass
- subfinder_{domain}.txt: Output from Subfinder
- assetfinder_{domain}.txt: Output from Assetfinder
- findomain_{domain}.txt: Output from Findomain
- {domain}.crt.txt: Output from crt.sh
- {domain}.subdomains.txt: Combined and unique subdomains from all tools
- {domain}.ips.txt: IP addresses associated with the discovered subdomains
- httpx_{domain}.txt: Results of the Httpx scan
- sorted_httpx_{domain}.txt: Sorted Httpx results
- naabu_{domain}.txt: Results of the Naabu scan
- nuclei_{domain}.txt: Results of the Nuclei scan
